Main Fuction：

Kalman_forward: The forward Klman filtering (FKF).
Kalman_backward: The backward Klman filtering (BKF).
denoise_d: Filtering deternimistic parameters.
denoise_r: Filtering irregular parameters.

Sub-Fuction：
get_scaleM: Getting Scale matrix.
v_gc2mc: Converting geoid coefficients (gc) to mass coefficients (mc).
vector2cs: Re-oreder SHCs from vector {S22,S21,C20,C21,C22;S33,S32,S31,C30,C31,C32,C33...} to matrix |C\S|.
cs2grid: Transforming SHCs to grids.
grid2cs_coefficient: Deriving the thansformation matrix from the spatial domain to the frequency domain.
func_pnm: Obtaining nomalized Plm.
func_weight_area: Deriving weight of grid on the sphere.
MMSE_Tikhonov: Determing the optimal adjust factor.

Input Data:
F_lm and HanWahrLoveNumbers: Used for the transformations of geoid coefficients (gc) to mass coefficients (mc).
time: Months in year (2002.04-2016.12).
yy: Observation values involving SHCs from Tongji-Grace 2018 model ordered in {S22,S21,C20,C21,C22;S33,S32,S31,C30,C31,C32,C33...}. The C20 has been replaced with TN14, the mean field of 2004-2009 has been removed.
Degree_one: The degree-one (from TN14; has been removed the mean filed) is used to be aded back to reconstructed mass SHCs).

Output data:
xd_filter: The final estimated deterministic parameters (with parameters denosing).
xr_filter: The final estimated irregular parameters (with parameters denosing).
grid_filter: The spatial mass changes (cm) include the effects of deterministic and irregular components,i.e.,
%%%
for i=1:n
% Observation matrix
A0=[1*IM (tt(i)-t0)*IM ((tt(i)-t0).^2)*IM cos(2*pi*(tt(i)-t0))*IM sin(2*pi*(tt(i)-t0))*IM cos(4*pi*(tt(i)-t0))*IM sin(4*pi*(tt(i)-t0))*IM];
% Reconstrction
y_new=A0*xd_filter+xr_filter(:,i); 
% The maximum degree is 60
cs=vector2cs(y_new,60); 
grid_filter(:,:,i)=cs2grid(cs);
end
%%%
grid_filter_removeGIA: The spatial mass changes (cm) (remove GIA effect (ICE-6G-C) from grid_filter).

Notice:
Due to the memory limitation of MATLAB software, in these codes, we divided the covariance matrices of observations from the Tongji-Grace2018 model during 2002-2016 into five parts: EE1 (2002.02-2004.12); EE2 (2005.01-2007.06); EE3 (2007.07-2009.12); EE4 (2010.01-2012.09); EE5 (2012.10-2016.12).
However, the size of the covariance matrices used in this paper (Tongji-Grace2018) is extremely large, rendering it impractical to provide them directly. If anyone is interested, please don’t hesitate to contact us at 2011480@tongji.edu.cn.
